# ToDo Project

TOP To Do project. This project will allow user to create a new task, set a due date and priority level. Navigation bars will allow user filter the tasks based on reminders or labels. Can set task to Completed or Delete. Tasks will be saved to users local storage to automatically update tasks every run.

Used what I've learned so far about module pattern, classes, and factory functions. Usage of npm and webpack. Writing and running npm scripts. Also added localStorage functions (setItem, getItem and removeItem).
